# Introduction

This is a 5 day project for Microverse, in this time I have had to learn how to use the Phaser 3 framework, develope all scenes and game instructions, find the different assets, test the game and meet all the given requirements.

# Story
In The middle of space , a earth Trooper is on a 20 year mission of space exploration with his team to discover a new galexy.
In the middle of the journy unexpected alien ships arise as a threat. Under attack, you as the captain must negivate through the army of space ship aliens and defeat them to gain enry into the next galexy and complete the mission.

## GameFlow

- The player has 1 life to defeat the aliens

# Planification

This project was developed in this schedule:

- Phase 1: Learn how to use Phase 3 Framework reading documentation and following tutorials.
- Phase 2: Choose the story to develop and planning how the code would be structured.
- Phase 3: Starting to code basic classes to develop the game.
- Phase 4: Fix issues
- Phase 5: Add extra features(score, lifes, multiple stages....).
- Phase 6: Testing the gameplay.
- Phase 7: Select and add all the assets to the game.
- Phase 8: Deployment.
